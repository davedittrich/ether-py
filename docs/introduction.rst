Introduction
============

This chapter introduces the ether-py Ethereum command line interface (``ether-py`` for short).

This CLI was inspired, in part, by the article `Creating a Python Ethereum Interface: Part 1`_ for
similar reasons. I not only wanted to do the same things, but to take advantage of the rich feature
set provided by `cliff <https://github.com/openstack/cliff>`_ for more output control,
built-in command help, modularity and extensibility.
